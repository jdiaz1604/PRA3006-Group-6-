# Genetic Differentiation Map (F_ST)

Click two countries to estimate genetic differentiation (F_ST) using a coarse mapping from country -> 1000 Genomes super-populations (AFR/AMR/EAS/EUR/SAS). Outputs a typical between-group F_ST estimate with clear caveats.

## Caveats
- Countries contain many populations; this is a panel-level proxy.
- Americas (e.g., Brazil) are often admixed (AMR).
- Not to be interpreted at individual level.

## Roadmap
- Replace placeholder F_ST matrix with literature-derived values (1000G).
- Expand country -> population mapping; allow admixture sliders.
- Add tooltips and educational links explaining F_ST.
